People claim the range to be about 1km which is a lot for our entire statement but as far as the authenticity is concerned we’ll have to check it out ourselves. The videos seem to be authentic there mostly wont be any major leaps in our experimental range

Protocols 

I2C
It uses only 2 bi-directional open-drain lines for data communication called SDA and SCL. Both these lines are pulled high.
Serial Data (SDA) – Transfer of data takes place through this pin.
Serial Clock (SCL) – It carries the clock signal.
I2C operates in 2 modes –
Master mode
Slave mode
Each data bit transferred on SDA line is synchronized by a high to the low pulse of each clock on the SCL line.
 
Features of I2C Communication Protocol :
Half-duplex Communication Protocol – 
Bi-directional communication is possible but not simultaneously.
Synchronous Communication – 
The data is transferred in the form of frames or blocks.
Can be configured in a multi-master configuration.
Clock Stretching – 
The clock is stretched when the slave device is not ready to accept more data by holding the SCL line low, hence disabling the master to raise the clock line. Master will not be able to raise the clock line because the wires are AND wired and wait until the slave releases the SCL line to show it is ready to transfer next bit.
Arbitration – 
I2C protocol supports multi-master bus system but more than one bus can not be used simultaneously. The SDA and SCL are monitored by the masters. If the SDA is found high when it was supposed to be low it will be inferred that another master is active and hence it stops the transfer of data.
Serial transmission – 
I2C uses serial transmission for transmission of data.
Used for low-speed communication.
Advantages :
Can be configured in multi-master mode.
Complexity is reduced because it uses only 2 bi-directional lines (unlike SPI Communication).
Cost-efficient.
It uses ACK/NACK feature due to which it has improved error handling capabilities.

SPI

Disadvantages of SPI:
It requires more signal lines (wires) than other communications methods(a problem in weight optimization not a primary concern though in PA das)
The communications must be well-defined in advance (latency  issues)
Usually, it supports only one master.
It does not check the error like the UART.
It uses more pins than the other protocol.
It can be used only from a short distance.
It does not give any acknowledgment that the data is received or not.

Advantages of SPI:
It's faster than asynchronous serial
The receive hardware can be a simple shift register
It supports multiple peripherals
It provides full-duplex communication.
There is no need for a unique address of the slave in this protocol.
This protocol does not require precise oscillation of slave devices because it uses the master's clock.
In this, software implementation is very simple.
It provides high transfer speed.
Signals are unidirectional.
It has separate lines of MISO and MOSI, so the data can be sent and received at the same time.
